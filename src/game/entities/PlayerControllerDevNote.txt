// Note: Player class is strictly for Soldier logic in original design
// To support Ship/Plane input for "Player", we should have made Player a Controller that possesses a Pawn.
// However, given current structure, Ship/Plane are Units, and Player is a Unit. 
// GameState creates "new Ship()" for player instead of "new Player()".
// So we need to ensure Ship and Plane handle INPUT themselves or GameState handles input for them.
// Let's check GameState logic -> it calls this.player.update().
// If this.player is a Ship, it calls Ship.update().
// But Ship.update currently does physics, but expects "vx" to be set.
// We need to ADD Input Handling to Ship/Plane update methods directly if they are "controlled by player".

// Actually, simpler fix: Add an 'input(inputManager)' method to Unit, override in Ship/Plane/Player.
// GameState calls this.player.handleInput(this.game.inputManager).
